TAKEN STEPS:

- Downloaded NPM starter and runned npm i
- changed some SCSS
- Tried to run server, so far without luck (investigation needed)
- Installed Grunt for watching LESS/SCSS files
- Fired up NPM run, seems like it's watching css now...
- double check :
[nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...

npm run watch: watched


- NPM RUN SERVER: fires away localhost:3000

Questions:
1. Do we leave all the bootstrap classes like they are? Guess so.
- Purely to distinguise bootstrap from our own css

Get elements/components from Bootstrap site.
After that turn on accomponying css/js
Dropdown for dropdowns etc.
Popper.js is also used for the dropdown elements
